4rimd

4rimd is a 4chan image downloader written in ruby. Just run this script against any 4chan category, e.g. /b/ and it will
download all images in the specified category. The script will ignore images which already exist, making it useful for incremental downloads, or resuming. 

4rimd was designed to be webmaster friendly thus it only downloads one image at a time. It does not use threads, nor does it hammer a web server. 

Enjoy!
